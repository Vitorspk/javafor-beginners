## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or text editor
- Basic command line knowledge

### Running the Exercises

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javafor-beginners.git
cd javafor-beginners
```

2. Compile a Java exercise file:
```bash
javac "Cap 01 Exercice 01"
```

3. Run the compiled class:
```bash
java Example
```

Note: Each file contains the class name in comments. Use that class name when running the program.

## File Naming Convention
Files are named following the pattern: `Cap XX Exercice YY`
- `Cap XX`: Chapter number (01-17)
- `Exercice YY`: Exercise number within that chapter

## Learning Path
For beginners, it's recommended to:
1. Start with Chapter 01 exercises
2. Progress sequentially through each chapter
3. Try to solve exercises independently before looking at the solutions
4. Experiment with modifying the code to understand concepts better

## Exercise Types
The repository includes various types of exercises:
- **Basic syntax exercises**: Understanding Java fundamentals
- **Problem-solving exercises**: Applying concepts to solve specific problems
- **Code completion exercises**: Filling in missing parts of programs
- **Debugging exercises**: Finding and fixing errors
- **Project-based exercises**: Building small applications

## Topics Covered
